# Creating pull requests (I like to call them merge requests, idk sounds better, but GitHub people do it differently)
1. Open your project with VSC
2. On left side press 3rd icon (looks like 3 connected circles), called source control
3. Press on 3 dots near the top, above blue button
4. Press pull
5. On the bottom there is main branch, press it
6. Press create new branch
7. Enter branch name (I usually use "update/...")
8. Do whatever changes in the code you want to
9. Go back to source control tab (on the left side)
10. Enter commit message
11. Press on the arrow on the blue button
12. Press `Commit & Push`
13. Press `yes` on some buttons if message box appears
14. Go to GitHub, there is pull request message
15. Assign it to youself (or Vairis)
16. Review it and merge changes
17. Probably you have fucked up along these lines, but if you got to this step you're done
